# Details
Have you ever solved "This is just one of those classic web challenges" before? Well, this is kinda like that one, except not really. For starters, the vulnerability is completely different. Also, this is a Flask application. Etc etc. All the best with this one. Again, not much else to tell you. This is just another one of those classic web challenges.
