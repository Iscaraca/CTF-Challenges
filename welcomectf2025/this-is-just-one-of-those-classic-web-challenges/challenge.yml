description: Have you ever solved a web challenge before? This one is kinda like that,
  sort of. You might be asking at this point, "What's this challenge about?" Well,
  its a shop. Surely you've done CTF challenges mimicking online marketplaces before.
  Those are a classic. Oh, but that's not all. This shop is written in PHP. Ain't
  that a common web challenge language. What else, you ask? Err.... I guess there's
  a profile page thing where you can edit your profile, that's also pretty typical.
  And it uses SQLite too. That's pretty much the whole challenge. All the best, I
  guess. Can't say much of anything else really. This is just one of those classic
  web challenges.
