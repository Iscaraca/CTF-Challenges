Have you ever solved a web challenge before? This one is kinda like that, sort of. You might be asking at this point, "What's this challenge about?" Well, its a shop. Surely you've done CTF challenges mimicking online marketplaces before. Those are a classic. Oh, but that's not all. This shop is written in PHP. Ain't that a common web challenge language. What else, you ask? Err.... I guess there's a profile page thing where you can edit your profile, that's also pretty typical. And it uses SQLite too. That's pretty much the whole challenge. All the best, I guess. Can't say much of anything else really. This is just one of those classic web challenges.
