One of your agents has found a proprietary stock market prediction service after enumerating Apocalypse's webservers! She believes that this endpoint was exposed on accident, and is one of the primary ways Apocalypse generates their income.

Are you able to exfiltrate their prediction algorithm for ehem ""further analysis"" before they disallow public access?

[Note: As the model must be as true to APOCALYPSE's as possible, the agency will only accept linear regression predictor objects from scikit-learn]
